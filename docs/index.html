    I was born in 1997 and the reason that I started university late because my education path did not go smoothly. In 2016, I did not choose the program carefully, there was nothing come out of my mind at that time and the program is still unfinished. Then, I was happy that my family, my friends and RMIT Vietnam still supported when I was totally ready to decide my program again.<br> 
    I love watching movies, especially Sci-Fi, horrors and politics. I am also into many sports such as soccer, basketball, badminton and maybe E-sport but I only play badminton. I am a humorous, talkative, and open-minded person, so I am willing to talk to many people and give advises if they need.<br>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>
    I have been interacting with the computer, the Internet for a long time and whenever I played video games or used the Internet I kept wondering how people can create them and there were so many questions inside my mind and they grew up my curiosity and a thought that one day I will learn how can people make these products. Then when I grew up, one of my brother who is studying at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology about Artificial Intelligence and he set up Google Home for most of electric devises in my house by himself, I was so admired him and he shared a lot of useful knowledge to me and taught me the C++ programming language. He is one of the best HCMUT students with 9.61/10 GPA. During working with him, I had a small project that was coding for an ATM machine which can remember customers card ID, password, amount of money that we deposit and withdraw. I know that it was not so impressive to many people, but it was something that I am proud of.<br>
    Obviously, studying at RMIT Vietnam has many advantages compared to other universities in Vietnam. Firstly, the biggest difference between RMIT and other universities is English, at RMIT every program, lecture is taught by totally English. The student who want to start university programs, must have at least IELTS 6.5 overall and no skill under 6.0 or finish English for University course with the examinations similar to IELTSâ€™s. Moreover, English was spoken by the most developed countries and it will be easy for RMIT student to get a good job in some international companies. Secondly, RMIT was founded in 1887 and had more than 100 years of reputation and experience, it also come from Australia which is one of the best countries in the world including education. Therefore, studying at RMIT students are able to absorb to knowledge from advanced and modern country or they will get opportunity to study in Australia and interact with international students.<br>
    When studying at RMIT university, I am looking forward to making new friends, partners who can go along with me on university path and careers when we finish the bachelors. Moreover, I have a huge interest in Artificial Intelligence, with RMIT I am able to get these knowledge and international teaching method. Furthermore, I acknowledge that not every IT technician know about the basics, the raw materials of programming, in stead they only focus on up-to-date programming languages such as C++ or Python. Therefore, I expect to learn the very first step of technology and programming. Then, I think AI will be the main thing that I need to concentrate on and find out the specific aspect of it to develop my skills for future career.<br>

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
  <p>
    https://www.vietnamworks.com/ky-su-phat-trien-thuat-toan-ai-salary-upto-2000-1273597-jv/?source=searchResults&searchType=2&placement=1273598&sortBy=date <br>
    Firstly, the reason why makes me interested in this job, is included in the title itself, I have a big passion on AI algorithm and the way that AI support human in improving work efficiency in their daily activities. According to SGGP news, Viettel was the second most valuable Vietnamese brand in 2019 and it is also a technology-based company who is first to develop 5G in Vietnam. So that, Viettel has one of the best environments for any employee, especially engineer who want to develop themselves in the future and work in a competitive area. Moreover, AI engineer at Viettel can possibly get paid up to thousands of US dollar a month, that is a dreaming amount of salary in my country.<br>
    With the high salary job at Viettel, the requirements are complicated such as graduation from university or higher degree which are relevant to Information Technology or Computer Science. English will be a compulsory part of the job with at least 550 TOEIC or 5.0 IELTS certification. Furthermore, the company require minimum one-year experiment about implement algorithm and some of programming languages such as Matlab, C/C++ and Python. <br>
    Now, it is not humble to say that my skills are still need a huge improvement at least 2 or 3 more years to reach the job minimum requirements. I have about one-year experiment on studying and practicing on C++ and I am learning Python from Introduction to Programming at RMIT university. Moreover, I also have some background knowledge of several application of AI such as object detection, recommendation system.<br>
    My plan to reach the requirement for the job position at Viettel will last for at least three years from now. Firstly, I need to finish bachelor of IT program at RMIT in 2022 with the average GPA 3.0, so that I need to achieve at least 70% of total score in every unit that I study. I know that it is not an easy target and I have to study independently minimum three hours a day because it takes around 10000 hours to become an expert at some specific aspect in IT. Studying at RMIT will help to reach the requirement of English because of the university requirement itself. Friends and lecturers at university will play an important role in my career path because I know that I am not perfect to go alone on study path and I need someone to work with and it also helps me in teamwork and partnership which are essential in workplace. After graduating from university, I definitely need experience at workplace by internship and at least one year working experiment to acquire the target.<br>
