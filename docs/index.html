  <h1>Personal Information</h1>
  <p>
    Full name: Nguyen Hung Dung (English name: Daniel).<br>
    Student ID: S3812648.<br>
    Email address: s3812648@rmit.edu.vn (for school and education), dungnov21@gmail.com (for personal purposes).<br>
    Nationality: Vietnam.<br>
    Education to date: 2022.<br>
    Spoken languages: Vietnamese, English.<br>
    I was born in 1997 and the reason that I started university late because my education path did not go smoothly. In 2016, I did not choose the program carefully, there was nothing come out of my mind at that time and the program is still unfinished. Then, I was happy that my family, my friends and RMIT Vietnam still supported when I was totally ready to decide my program again.<br><br> 
    I love watching movies, especially Sci-Fi, horrors and politics. I am also into many sports such as soccer, basketball, badminton and maybe E-sport but I only play badminton. I am a humorous, talkative, and open-minded person, so I am willing to talk to many people and give advises if they need.<br>

  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <p>
    I have been interacting with the computer, the Internet for a long time and whenever I played video games or used the Internet I kept wondering how people can create them and there were so many questions inside my mind and they grew up my curiosity and a thought that one day I will learn how can people make these products. Then when I grew up, one of my brother who is studying at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology about Artificial Intelligence and he set up Google Home for most of electric devises in my house by himself, I was so admired him and he shared a lot of useful knowledge to me and taught me the C++ programming language. He is one of the best HCMUT students with 9.61/10 GPA. During working with him, I had a small project that was coding for an ATM machine which can remember customers card ID, password, amount of money that we deposit and withdraw. I know that it was not so impressive to many people, but it was something that I am proud of.<br><br>
    Obviously, studying at RMIT Vietnam has many advantages compared to other universities in Vietnam. Firstly, the biggest difference between RMIT and other universities is English, at RMIT every program, lecture is taught by totally English. The student who want to start university programs, must have at least IELTS 6.5 overall and no skill under 6.0 or finish English for University course with the examinations similar to IELTS’s. Moreover, English was spoken by the most developed countries and it will be easy for RMIT student to get a good job in some international companies. Secondly, RMIT was founded in 1887 and had more than 100 years of reputation and experience, it also come from Australia which is one of the best countries in the world including education. Therefore, studying at RMIT students are able to absorb to knowledge from advanced and modern country or they will get opportunity to study in Australia and interact with international students.<br><br>
    When studying at RMIT university, I am looking forward to making new friends, partners who can go along with me on university path and careers when we finish the bachelors. Moreover, I have a huge interest in Artificial Intelligence, with RMIT I am able to get these knowledge and international teaching method. Furthermore, I acknowledge that not every IT technician know about the basics, the raw materials of programming, in stead they only focus on up-to-date programming languages such as C++ or Python. Therefore, I expect to learn the very first step of technology and programming. Then, I think AI will be the main thing that I need to concentrate on and find out the specific aspect of it to develop my skills for future career.<br>

  <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
  <p>
    https://www.vietnamworks.com/ky-su-phat-trien-thuat-toan-ai-salary-upto-2000-1273597-jv/?source=searchResults&searchType=2&placement=1273598&sortBy=date <br><br>
    Firstly, the reason why makes me interested in this job, is included in the title itself, I have a big passion on AI algorithm and the way that AI support human in improving work efficiency in their daily activities. According to SGGP news, Viettel was the second most valuable Vietnamese brand in 2019 and it is also a technology-based company who is first to develop 5G in Vietnam. So that, Viettel has one of the best environments for any employee, especially engineer who want to develop themselves in the future and work in a competitive area. Moreover, AI engineer at Viettel can possibly get paid up to thousands of US dollar a month, that is a dreaming amount of salary in my country.<br><br>
    With the high salary job at Viettel, the requirements are complicated such as graduation from university or higher degree which are relevant to Information Technology or Computer Science. English will be a compulsory part of the job with at least 550 TOEIC or 5.0 IELTS certification. Furthermore, the company require minimum one-year experiment about implement algorithm and some of programming languages such as Matlab, C/C++ and Python. <br><br>
    Now, it is not humble to say that my skills are still need a huge improvement at least 2 or 3 more years to reach the job minimum requirements. I have about one-year experiment on studying and practicing on C++ and I am learning Python from Introduction to Programming at RMIT university. Moreover, I also have some background knowledge of several application of AI such as object detection, recommendation system.<br><br>
    My plan to reach the requirement for the job position at Viettel will last for at least three years from now. Firstly, I need to finish bachelor of IT program at RMIT in 2022 with the average GPA 3.0, so that I need to achieve at least 70% of total score in every unit that I study. I know that it is not an easy target and I have to study independently minimum three hours a day because it takes around 10000 hours to become an expert at some specific aspect in IT. Studying at RMIT will help to reach the requirement of English because of the university requirement itself. Friends and lecturers at university will play an important role in my career path because I know that I am not perfect to go alone on study path and I need someone to work with and it also helps me in teamwork and partnership which are essential in workplace. After graduating from university, I definitely need experience at workplace by internship and at least one year working experiment to acquire the target.<br>

  <p>
    I have taken three different tests: MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) test on a website with address: 16personalities.com, online learning style test on whatismylearningstyle.com and The Big Five Personality Test on truity.com. The result of MBTI shows that I have campaigner personality and I do not think it is 100% accurate because there are some points that I do think it describe myself such as in reality I do not like to spend much time on exploring social relationships and I like making online friends via computer games and I do not think that I have poor practical skills as the website said. However, the second test seem easy to detect what my learning style is and I was not surprised about the result that is visual learner because I have already known it for a long time and I can feel it. Next, the final test about my big five personalities that are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism. I got result 77%, 40%, 65%, 73% and 58% respectively and I do think they are accurate about Extraversion because I know that I am an introvert-type person and I do not talk about myself or my personal things a lot.<br><br> 
    As the report instruction and these websites state that there is no guarantee about all the information and results correct, so they are not a big problem and concern for me. Moreover, I can figure out what I love doing and my advantages which is suitable for the chosen program. I will let all the information aside and keep doing what I am good at in the future because only me who understand myself. There will be no big influence or change on my behaviors in a team and as I said before I want to have true friends who will be with me on the future path.<br><br>
 	  Personally, the results of these tests do not really affect my when forming a team for any project. I think the most important thing that I care about when creating a team are member’s attitude about the project, their contributions. Moreover, I am willing to take position of team leader if they want and I think I am able to finish to job effectively.<br>

  <h1>Project Ideas</h1>
  <p>
  Overall, the world is changing rapidly due to the development of technology and people are working on creating artificial assistants which help people in most things in their lives and reduce tasks. Artificial Intelligence become explosive nowadays because GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) has stepped on another level, so that computer science has reached the demand of hardware. Up to date, there are thousands of technologies applied AI to maximum its performance. Therefore, my project aims to use AI and it is also the way to develop my skills that will be useful for in future career, especially algorithm. I am impressed by personal assistants and I think that it is a big innovation that AI brings to our lives and improve living quality. About my project idea, I want to work on AI related field, and it is face identification.<br><br>
<h3>Overview</h3>
I am an ambitious person, so that my project idea (FaceX) for my future will be face identification which is an application help machines, devices to remember human faces and recognize them correctly. The application is able to tell that is the right or wrong person by checking and comparing between the data and current face, then ensure it must be some lively features such as eyes, nose or lips to avoid approving pictures. The project is realistic idea because there are many technology giants who has successfully created and owned this kind of technology such as Apple, Samsung.<br><br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
There are many reasons and purposes why FaceX is useful for many activities in human routines. With more than 7 billion people in the world and it will never be a completely detailed similarity of two faces even if it is a couple of twins. Therefore, the data of your face can be accessed by only yourself and used in many purposes such as security, paying bills or even ID. For example, people need not bring many personal belongings when they go outside and maybe lose them, in stead they can use their faces to pay for what they want to buy without carrying cash or cards, unlock their house’s doors without keys and even unlock their phones with a look.<br><br>
<h3>Description</h3>
The reason of FaceX is to enhance the quality of human life, bring the convenience and reduce the unnecessary activities. The system must be equipped a camera which help collect data and then recognize human faces. By getting the data, FaceX need to take about a hundred picture of their faces in just a moment (if your camera has 30fps, it will take just more than 3 seconds). After that, the system will use ‘OpenCV’ library to detect human faces in the photos and crop it to save in the folder where only contain the same face in the future. Then using an AI public model to learn the unique features and specialties on the face such as eyes, nose or lips extracted from data. After training the model carefully by testing as many faces as possible and try to recognize strange faces which never recorded in the database until it reaches the expected accuracy which is the requirement for the next step. The step is about to access to the database and get personal information included saved pictures for confirmations after approving actions such as transactions or unlocking doors. Moreover, the system will automatically learn more about human faces after each action to improve the accuracy in the future. For instance, FaceID of iPhone cannot recognize the owner’s faces when they just wake up due to some small unexpected deform on their faces, but after a certain amount of time it will learn and improve itself to approve the same face in different situations. FaceX can be used in many different purposes because everyone has face and they are never similar to each other. Security will be a significant example for FaceX, when every citizen creates their ID card the government need to take their face data in order to find criminals by using surveillance. It helps the country control and reduce crime. People can apply the technology on many different aspects such as door because we all have forgot our house keys once or lost it and it is so annoying, with FaceX and a camera in front of your house you easily access to your house without using hands and it is impossible for thieves to break in your house.<br><br>
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
First of all, about programming language will be 100% Python which is the most popular for AI applications and projects, the project will be programmed on PyCharm and some of Python libraries such as ‘TensorFlow’, ‘Keras’ to build and train model that can recognize whose face is, then we use ‘OpenCV’ to detect the faces in the input videos and pictures. Secondly, about hardware, at least one modern camera and an embedded computer such as NVIDIA JETSON series.<br><br>
<h3>Skills Required </h3>
We need to master Python programming language along with all related libraries. Then, knowledge about implement AI algorithm, deep learning by studying online course from Cousera and also friends, lecturers at university. This possibility that we can reach to skill requirement is high because we plan to do it for years and there are many people who has succeeded on the similar project, so there is nothing impossible if we do not try.<br><br>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
As I said before, the percentage of success is positive because there are many people who has been successful on developing this system. If I were able to create this system completely, it could be my life achievement and with this success I can gain many reputations, money, and positions in workplace. This development of product will forever change the way that customers use the many types of product from entertainment to safety reasons. We can sell it to many technology companies in the world or collab with them to get money.
